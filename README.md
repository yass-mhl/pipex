This project is the detailed discovery and programming of a UNIX mechanism (pipes)


## Goals

This program will run as follows:

    ./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2

It must take 4 arguments:

- file1 and file2 are file names.
- cmd1 and cmd2 are shell commands with their parameters

This program should behave exactly like the following shell command:
